    "1. Determine the normal velocity $\\vec U \\cdot \\hat n$ at a point $(x,y)$ due to roll motion in $z$ around the point $(x_m,y_m)$. Briefly explain why this is the RHS of the equation $\\mathbf{A q_6=b_6}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the normal-velocity influence matrix, and $\\mathbf{q_6}$ is the panel source strength vector. Determine the equation for the roll added inertia $m_{66}$ in terms of these vectors and the potential influence function $F^\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `roll(x,y,xm=0,ym=0)` which takes in an array of section coordinates `x,y` and a center of roll motion `(xm,ym)` and returns the roll source strength $\\mathbf{q_6}$ and added inertia $m_{66}$. Validate the `roll` function by comparing to a known exact $m_{66}$ value for a fully submerged shape. Clearly cite your source, determine the number of panels required to achieve 1% error and plot the flow on the shape. \n"
