    "# Assignment 1(a): Roll added-inertia of a submerged body\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note: This assignment is incomplete and subject to change\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will extend the functions from the panel method notebook to predict the flow and forces induced by **roll motion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Sketch_ a body subject to roll motion $\\Omega_z=U_6$ around the point $(x_m,y_m)$. _Determine_ the equation for the normal velocity $\\vec U \\cdot \\hat n$ at a point $(x,y)$ on the body. Using this, _define_ the RHS of the equation $\\mathbf{A q_6=b_6}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the normal-velocity influence matrix, and $\\mathbf{q_6}$ is the scaled source strength due to roll. _Determine_ the equation for the roll added-inertia $m_{66}$ in terms of these variables and the potential influence function $F^\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Write_ a function `roll` which takes in the coordinate arrays `x,y` defining a shape and the roll center `x_m,y_m` and returns `q_6` and `m_{66}`. _Validate_ the `roll` function by comparing to a known $m_{66}$ for a fully submerged shape (cite your reference) and _discuss_ the convergence behaviour. _Plot_ the induced flow and _discuss_ it's physical characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Solution format: Write-up your solution for both parts, including screen-shots of important functions and the results plots, and submit as a `PDF`. Submit the working python code needed to reproduce those plots as a `py` or `ipynb`. \n",
    "* Note: Explain your method/results in the write-up, not in the code. Any time you are tempted to write \"see code for ____\", put the important information in the write-up instead."
