    "Recall from [the first notebook](https://github.com/weymouth/MarineHydro/blob/master/notebooks/panel_method.ipynb) that the scaled potential $\\phi_k$ due to motion in degree of freedom $k$ is defined as a superposition of the contributions from each panel $i$\n",

    "That's it for the second notebook. Let's review the main takeaway points:\n",
    " 1. To solve for potential flows with a free surface, we **only** need to modify the Green's function to include the surface wave potential induced by the source. No other changes are needed to any of the functions from the previous notebook!\n",
    " 2. The wave potential, and therefore the flow solutions and forces, inherently **depends on the oscillation frequency** because of the free surface boundary conditions. \n",
    " 3. In addition to the added-mass force in phase with body acceleration, there is also a **wave damping force** in phase with the body velocity which carries energy away from the body.\n",
    " 4. The forces may vary drastically with frequency, particularly near resonance. Internal or external **standing waves** cause singularities in the force.\n",
    " 5. A **parametric study** sweeps over one or more nondimensional parameters of interest such as a geometric ratio, and can provide important insights into a marine design. "
