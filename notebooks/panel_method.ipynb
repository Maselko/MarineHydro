    "That's it for this notebook. We covered a lot, so go back through and make sure you understand the key points:\n",
    " 1. Panel methods are a numerical approach to compute the potential flow around an engineering geometry by breaking it up into small panels (or line segments in 2D).\n",
    " 2. Each panel is an integrated Green's function (such as a source singularity) with a variable strength and the total flow is the superposition (sum) of each panel's contribution. \n",
    " 3. The strengths $q_i$ are determined by solving a system of linear equations for the normal velocity through every panel.\n",
    " 4. Once the strengths are known, they can be used to plot the flow and determine the added mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that numerical methods should never be trusted until they have been properly validated. In this case:\n",
    " 1. We checked that the potential and velocity plots as well as the added mass values were all **physically reasonable**.\n",
    " 2. We ensured that the source strength **converges** with increasing number of panels and\n",
    " 3. We **validated** the code against the known analytic added mass values for an ellipse geometry."
