# Marine Hydro notebooks on your personal computer

The Marine Hydro notebooks can be opened and used directly from your browser (just click on this badge [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/weymouth/marinehydro)). However, it is straightforward to run the notebooks on your personal computer so you can work offline and save your edits. 

1.  Install Jupyter

	“The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.“ – [Jupyter.org](http://Jupyter.org)

	_Option A_: [install Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) to get python, Jupyter, and pretty much everything else you might need.
  
	_Option B_: [install Jupyter alone](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if that's all you need.
	
2.  Copy the MarineHydro notebooks to your computer

	_Option A_: [use `git` to `fork` the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

	_Option B_: [download the zipfile](archive/master.zip), and then unzip
  
	If you are interested in coding, or need to code for your IP/MSc project, you should be using `git`. [Github has a nice set of introduction/help documents.](https://help.github.com/)

3.  [Run the notebooks with jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)
