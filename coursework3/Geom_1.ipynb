    "##### Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The duct will be modeled in 2D as two mirror-image sections (colored grey in the figure above). You can choose one of the foil sections we looked at in the module or find an alternative in the literature (some level of approximation in that case is fine). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parametric study \n",
    "\n",
    "You will study the impact of the duct 'diameter' $d$ versus chord $c$ while keeping the section properties fixed. (Since this is 2D, it is really the section spacing versus the chord.) Use as many values as you need to identify the trends in the range $0.5\\le d/c\\le 5$. Make sure the geometry and resulting flow are reasonable across the parameter range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the total drag on the duct and the point of separation $x/c$ on the inside and outside surfaces over the parameter range. Predict the velocity profile and mass flow rate through the duct over the parameter range. Make sure to explain and validate any code you develop for these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss how you could use your results to determine the impact of $d/c$ on the performance of the propeller. Discuss the advantages and limitations of this analysis. "
