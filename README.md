## Marine Hydrodynamics with Jupyter Notebooks

These IPython notebooks contain content for the *Marine Hydrodynamics* course at The University of Southampton, taught by [Gabriel Weymouth](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/about/staff/gdw1d12.page). The course covers analytical potential flow, boundary layer theory, and numerical methods. The notebooks are used primarily for the numerical portion of the course.

Teaching numerical hydrodynamics with [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) was inspired by [AeroPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython) developed by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/).
